# SOEN357Project

Pro-Local is a UI/UX Research Project.

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Pro-Local is an online one-stop shop that promots local Canadian businesses that were affected by the pandemic closure.

Given the current pandemic and its ease of use, many people have turned to online shopping. By buying from these giant corporations, many smaller local businesses are losing their customer bases and are in danger of going bankrupt.

In order to drum up business for these local stores, we will be creating a one-stop shop to buy from businesses close to you. By avoiding the hassle of having to order from multiple different sites, we hope to increase local business and support our community.
